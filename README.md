* The center column has the image of burger recipes and allows the user to add a burger of their choice to the app.

## Requirements completed

* The program is fully functional application and does not have any known bugs.

* Once the user has added a burger, it appears on the left card under the picture of a burger and the heading "Burgers to Eat".  Here the user can choose to devour the the burger by clicking the "Devour it!" button.

* Once the user has clicked the devour button, the burger will go to the far right card and appear under the breadcrumbs image and heading "Burgers devoured!".  If the user loved that burger, then it can be reordered by clicking the "order it!" button.  If the user orders the burger again, it will reappear in the Burgers to eat card.
